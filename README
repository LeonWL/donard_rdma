This package provides a pair of executables to test RDMA use with PCI
mapped memory.

There is a server and a client. The server maps memory either from the
CPU or a PCI device and the client tests the bandwidth of reads and/or
writes.

The server has three options for choosing the memory:

1) With no options, it defaults to allocating CPU buffers.

2) With the -g option it will properly allocate and pin Nvidia GPU memory and
   use it as the buffer3

3) With the -m option you may specify any mmappable file to use as a
   buffer. Note: this will only work as expected if the file maps to
   physical memory not disk pages. A good example of this are raw PCI
   BAR spaces in

   /sys/bus/pci/devices/<pci device>/resource*
